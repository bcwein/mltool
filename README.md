This repository is created because during the spring of 2021 I will have to make machine learning code from scratch during my studies. I want to store and organise this code to a python package which i have named **mltool**.  

## Latest Update - 20201231
This github repository is initialised and have been setup with workflows for building the anaconda environment. The semester starts at the 4th of January 2021 and i expect that i will begin programming after that. 

## Purpose
The purpose for this repository is primarily learning and the syllabus that is to be learned as of 31th of December 2020 is the following courses

- [Machine Learning](https://www.uis.no/nb/course/ELE520_1)
- [Data intensive systems](https://www.uis.no/nb/course/DAT500_1)
- [Data mining and deep learning](https://www.uis.no/nb/course/DAT550_1)

Therefore, the main goal is not the fastest possible code but implemenation of code from scratch such that the topics are learned. The repository is published and public since i want to share the code that i produce and my work in learning these subjects in case it would be of interest for other people.
